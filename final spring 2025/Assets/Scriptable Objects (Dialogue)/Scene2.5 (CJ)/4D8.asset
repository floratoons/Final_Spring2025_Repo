  - "She looks really genuine. It makes your chest hurt. You don\u2019t mean to shut
    people out, especially not a good friend of yours, but it\u2019s just hard to
    talk to people when you\u2019re so exhausted all the time."
  - "It\u2019s hard to feel like you\u2019re not wasting their time when the only
    thing you can really manage is being in the same space as someone. But you know
    CJ doesn\u2019t mind."
  - "You look up at her, and find her gazing past you, at the people on the big ferry
    behind you. Honey should be up there\u2026 and you can\u2019t help but wonder
    what CJ\u2019s thinking."
