  - You take them all in. A tall, pretty young man with gold-rimmed glasses, people
    with stripes and vibrant colors dyed into their hair, girls wearing frilly patterned
    skirts with bags heavy with charms and plush keychains.
  - "Not exactly the typical ghost-hunting tourists that have been so\u2026 everywhere,
