  - "You exchange phone numbers, making the new contact \u2018Honey,\u2019 and you
    watch as she types your name into her phone and adds about a million heart emojis
    after it."
  - Flustered, a little flushed, you say goodbye to her as the group surrounding
    her starts chatting excitedly about the ferry whose arrival is signaled by the
    loud foghorn atop its black-painted hull.
  - Honey shrugs and flashes you another frankly adorable smile, and waves to you
    as her little posse pulls her away.
